Go_101
======

My Completion of Jim Canning's 101 C Programming Problems in Go. These problems were assigned to me as homework assignments when I started out in school. The assignments range in difficulty from trivial to complex, and include a great amount of practice to understanding the basic usage of the standard libraries in addition to programming foundations.

I've decided to redo the assignments in Go to learn its syntax and fundamentals. I understand that the Problems may not provide sufficient practice for things specific to Go such as slices, in which case I'll be sure to read up on the community's content and create exercises/examples of my own. 

Here are a list of the problems that have been completed thus far. I've categorized them by the particular material or task that is involved. The list of programming problems are described in 101.pdf.

##Please feel free to contribute if you'd like!##
I'm completing assignments as I learn so mistakes are bound to be present. Whether it be assignments I haven't completed, errors or bad habits that I've made (I know that I forgot to close some files a few times), I will seriously invest my time in any feedback/recommendation.

##Future Plans and Other Notes##
- To further supplement my learning and make this repo more useful, I'll slowly be working on adding a writeup as a separate file in the directory of the problems. This will also promote organization of static file generation which I will be looking into.
- Short declarations are not used in favor of fighting laziness. I'd like to understand and maintain control of the data types that are used. When making corrections or contributing, feel free to do whatever you'd like.
- I apologize in advance for my overuse of the newline escape sequence =3.
