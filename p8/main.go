/*******************************************************************************
Problem #8: One Horizontal Line of Asterisks
Author: Corey Prak
Date Created: 04/03/2014

Description:
Create a file called testdata8 that has a single integer value stored into it.
The integer will be a number between 1 and 30 inclusive. Create a C program
that uses the fscanf function to read in this integer value and then prints a
horizontal line containing that many asterisksâ€™ (*). Use a for-loop in your
program.

- Added comments.

- Made HUGE changes to code.

- Decided not to remove short declarations to show how elegant the code could
  be.

- Must REMEMBER TO CLOSE THE FILE. I can't seem to get that into my head.

	   just yet, so omit it with an underscore. */

	if scanErr != nil {
		fmt.Println(scanErr)
		return

	for i = 0; i < numberFromFile; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("*")
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n")

	filePtr.Close()
